# Lappalainen Lab Workflows

This repository contains workflow files for various pipelines. These workflows are written in a workflow langauge (eg. [WDL](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl), [CWL](https://www.commonwl.org)) and are designed to be used in the context of a workflow manager (eg. [Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable)). See READMEs in workflow subdirectories for more details.
